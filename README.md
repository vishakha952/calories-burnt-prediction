# 🔥 Calories Burned Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity using **Machine Learning** models. By analyzing input features such as exercise duration, heart rate, body measurements, and other parameters, the model estimates calorie expenditure with good accuracy.  

## 📌 Project Overview
Calorie estimation is useful for:
- **Fitness tracking apps**
- **Diet & health monitoring**
- **Personal trainers and athletes**
- **Medical and wellness research**

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Training and evaluating multiple ML models  
- Visualizing performance metrics

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains features such as:
- Gender  
- Age  
- Height & Weight  
- Duration of exercise  
- Heart Rate  
- Body Temperature  
- Target: **Calories burned**

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas` → data handling  
  - `numpy` → numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` → data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → ML algorithms & evaluation  

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented
The following ML models were tested:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  

The performance of each model was compared using **R² score, MAE, and RMSE**.
